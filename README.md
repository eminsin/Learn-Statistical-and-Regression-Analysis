# Learn Statistics and Regression Analysis with R

+ The chapters above were created during the dates specified in each file by 
  + following the book ["Using R for Introductory Statistics"](https://cbb.sjtu.edu.cn/~mywu/bi217/usingR.pdf) by John Verzani,
  + scripting on **Notepad++** , executing on **R 4.1.1** and **R Studio** using the stardard libraries,
  + practising with real world data in **UsingR and MASS libraries** by **me, Erkam Minsin**.
