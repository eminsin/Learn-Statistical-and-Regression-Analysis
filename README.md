# Learn Statistics and Regression Analysis with R

+ The chapters above were created during the dates specified in each file by 
  + following the book ["Using R for Introductory Statistics"](https://cbb.sjtu.edu.cn/~mywu/bi217/usingR.pdf) by John Verzani,
  + scripting on **Notepad++** , executing on **R 4.1.1** and **R Studio** using the stardard libraries,
  + practising with real world data in **UsingR and MASS libraries** by **me, Erkam Minsin**.

#### Chapter 1: Getting Started with R
In this chapter, we learn how to install and use R, along with basic R syntax and data types. We also learn how to use RStudio, a popular integrated development environment for R.

Chapter 2: Basic Operations
In this chapter, we cover basic operations in R, including arithmetic operations, logical operators, and character manipulation.

Chapter 3: Descriptive Statistics
In this chapter, we learn how to use R to compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, and how to create graphical representations of data.

Chapter 4: Probability
In this chapter, we cover the basics of probability theory, including the rules of probability, conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem.

Chapter 5: Distributions
In this chapter, we cover probability distributions, including the normal distribution, t-distribution, and chi-squared distribution.

Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing
In this chapter, we cover hypothesis testing, including the null hypothesis, p-values, and the t-test.

Chapter 7: Regression
In this chapter, we cover linear regression, including the basics of regression analysis, simple linear regression, and multiple linear regression.

Chapter 8: ANOVA
In this chapter, we cover analysis of variance (ANOVA), including one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA.

Chapter 9: Nonparametric Methods
In this chapter, we cover nonparametric methods, including the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the sign test.

Chapter 10: Resampling Methods
In this chapter, we cover resampling methods, including the bootstrap and permutation tests.
